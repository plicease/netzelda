          His way        :  I defend the kingdom with all the skill I 
                            possess; I'm not about to let you and your
                            pathetic attempts at actual combat get in my
                            way.

          Favorite weapon:  Magic Sword (it's all I need)

          Favorite level :  Death Mountain (9)

          Favorite item  :  Stepladder

          A quote        :  "Deflection, then infliction of pain."
