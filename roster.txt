    Link is our founding member and the co-creator of Net Zelda.

    Dodongo wrote at least half of the code and is our chief troubleshooter.

    Wizzrobe is our recruiting officer and the game's s3m assembler.

    Like-Like joined us after playing Net Quake once.  ONCE.

    Aquamentus is all that and a pouch of rupees.  Bakes good cookies, too.

    Octorok has a chip on his shoulder and lives to shred MOG'ers.

    Zola is one foxy fish-woman.

    Tektite isn't a loser, but he plays one on the Net.

    Pol's Voice couldn't think of anything to put here.
